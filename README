kv
==

kv is a simple, header-only key-value config reader for C.  It is implemented
using X Macros.


format
------

Configuration file is read from standard input, one line per field of the
key-value struct.  Each line is expected to follow `%s = %s\n` format.
Conversions are provided for integers, double precision floats, booleans
(formatted as: `T`, `True` or `true`), characters and strings.  Maximum length
of keys and values is chosen arbitrarily to be 256.

	# comments can be removed with sed
	key1 = 1   # int
	key2 = 1.0 # double
	key3 = T   # bool
	key4 = O   # char
	key5 = /   # char *


usage
-----

Included are `example.c` and `example.conf` files, with Planck+15
cosmology data.

	make
	sed 's/#.*//' ./example.conf | ./example

Notice that `kv.h` header file must be included *after* defining a
`KV` macro.
