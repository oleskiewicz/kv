kv
==

kv is a simple, header-only key-value config reader for C.  It is implemented using X
Macros.  The advantage of this approach is that it generates code for parsing, printing,
and serialising the configuration files all at once.


format
------

Configuration file is read from standard input, one line per field of the key-value
struct.  Each line is expected to follow `%s = %s\n` format.  Conversions are provided
for integers, double precision floats, booleans (formatted as: `T`, `True` or `true`),
characters and strings.  Empty keys and lines are silently discarded.  Maximum length of
keys and values is BUFSIZ.

	# comments can be removed with sed
	key1 = 1       # int
	key2 = 1.0     # double
	key3 = T       # bool
	key4 = O       # char
	key5 = /       # char *
	key6 = 1,2,3   # int *


usage
-----

See included `example.c` and `example.conf` files, with Planck+15 cosmology data.

	make
	< example.conf sed 's/#.*//' | ./example

Notice that `kv.h` header file must be included **after** defining a `KV` macro.
